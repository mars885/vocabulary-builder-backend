The idea is to create an Android app that will help people master the vocabulary they're struggling with.
The basic functionality of the app consists of the following:
1. The ability to look up a word.
2. If the word does not exist, give a user the option of submitting the request for a new word (something like
'Help us make the dictionary even better').
3. The ability to mark the word as learning if the user desires to master that word.
4. The ability to master the words through quizzes.
5. A lot of preset quizzes types (listening quiz, definitions quiz, words quiz, etc.) for this day, last day, last week, etc.
6. The ability to search users and see what words they're learning, what words they have mastered, their favorites, etc.
7. Trending words, i.e. words that are being learnt by quite a few people.
